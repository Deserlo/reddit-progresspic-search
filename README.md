# React + Flask 

## ProgressPic Subreddit App 
- Seeing others go through positive body transformations is motivating. I thought a web app that allows users to filter and display progress pic posts based on selected fields. Eg ['weight lost', 'gender', 'age', 'starting weight', 'current weight'] would be nice. That way someone could for example query posts based on the wt loss or wt gain goal they have for themselves.
